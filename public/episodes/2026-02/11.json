      "explanation": "Fluid Lending's $1.3B TVL across five chains, including Ethereum and Arbitrum, showcases its ability to attract liquidity in diverse ecosystems, which is crucial for lending protocols to maintain competitive interest rates and attract borrowers. The presence on multiple chains also indicates a strategic approach to tap into varying user bases and liquidity pools.",

      "explanation": "Fluid Lending has a significant lead on Ethereum with $719M in TVL compared to Plasma's $367M, reflecting Ethereum's robust ecosystem and user base that drive higher liquidity and lending activity. The 49% margin indicates a strong preference for Ethereum-based lending solutions over those on Plasma, likely due to better integration with other DeFi protocols.",

      "answerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Fluid Lending reached its all-time high (ATH) of $2.4B in October 2025, which stands out from other choices like November 2024 and June 2025, where the protocol was still gaining traction but hadn't yet hit its peak. This timing reflects the growing interest and adoption of fluid lending models in the DeFi space, which likely contributed to its significant valuation at that point.",
